# DataStructures
This repo contains my projects (programs) from Data Structures and Algorithms.

All the (or most) of the projects use an algorithm java library given to us by our professor. 

The library can be found at this link: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/

#Program 2
In program 2 there is a PDF file that shows a representation of the amount of time taken to run the FindMedianTest.java for different types of algorithms. The file contains a log log plot vs time graph. The times are seperated by the size of the arrays that are tested in the program.
